\title{Compute average nearest neighbor distance}
\usage{
avg_nn_dist(xy_coords)

avg_nn_dist(xy_coords)
}
\arguments{
\item{xy_coords}{a matrix with n-dimenstional coordinates}

\value{
a vector of average distances for each sequential number
  of accumulated nearest samples.

a vector of average distances for each sequential number
  of accumulated nearest samples.
}
\description{
This function computes the average distance of the next
nearest sample for a given set of coordinates. This method
of sampling is used  by the function \code{rarefaction}
when building the spatial accumulation curves
