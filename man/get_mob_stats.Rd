\description{
Calculate sample based and group based biodiversity statistics.

\details{
\strong{Rarefied species richness} is the expected number of species, given
a defined number of sampled individuals (Gotelli & Colwell 2001). Rarefied richness
at the sample and group level is calculated for the values provided in
\code{n_rare_samples} and \code{n_rare_groups}, respectively.
When no values are provided the minimum number of individuals of the samples 
or groups is used. \code{S_rare} is calculated using the function \code{\link{rarefaction}}.

\strong{Asymptotic species richness} is calculated using the bias-corrected Chao1
 estimator (Chiu et al. 2014) provided in the function \code{\link[vegan]{estimateR}}.

\strong{PIE} represents the probility that two randomly drawn individuals represent
belong to the same species. Here we use the definition of Hurlbert (1971), which considers
sampling without replacement. PIE is closely related to the well-known Simpson 
diversity index, but the latter assumes sampling with replacement.

\strong{ENS_PIE} represents the Effective Number of Species derived from PIE.
This corresponds to the the number of equally abundant species, which together result
in the same PIE as the observed community, with - most likely - uneven abundances
(Jost 2006). That means the higher the difference between S and ENS_PIE the more
uneven is the observed community. An intuitive interpretation of ENS_PIE is that
it corresponds to the number of dominant species in the community.

For species richness \code{S} and the Effective Number of Species \code{ENS_PIE}
we also calculate beta-diversity using multiplicative partitioning
(Whittaker 1972, Jost 2007). That means for both indices we estimate beta-diversity as the ratio of group-level
diversity (gamma) divided by sample-level diversity (alpha). 

We used permutation tests for assessing differences of the biodiversity statistics
among the groups (Legendre & Legendre 1998). At the sample level, one-way ANOVA (i.e. F-test) is implemented
by shuffeling treatment group labels across samples.

 At the group-level there is test whether the difference between treatment and control is significantly different from zero. For this purpose we permuted treatment group labels across samples, pooled the groups, and calculated the treatment-control difference for each permutation.
