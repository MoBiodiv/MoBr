\title{Auxiliary function for computing S and the effect on S of 
the three components of community structure: SAD, N, and aggregation}
\usage{
get_delta_curves(x, tests = c("SAD", "N", "agg"), inds = NULL,
  ind_dens = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{can either be a: 1) mob_in object or 2) a vector which contains
the abundance of each species (i.e., the SAD). All effects can be computed
when x is a mob_in object but only the SAD effect can be computed when
x is a vector of species abundances.}

\item{tests}{what effects to compute defaults to 'SAD', 'N', and 'agg'}

\item{ind_dens}{the density of individuals to compare against for computing
N effect}
