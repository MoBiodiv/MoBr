\title{Permute community matrix within groups}
\usage{
permute_comm(comm, method, groups = NULL)

permute_comm(comm, method, groups = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{comm}{community matrix with plots as rows and species columns.}

\item{method}{either 'noagg' for random shuffling of the individuals without
mantaining the vector of sample total abundances or 'swapN' for random 
shuffling of the individuals in which sample abundances are mantained}

\item{groups}{optional argument that is a vector of group ids which specify
which group each site is associated with. If is NULL then all rows of the
community matrix are assumed to be members of the same group}

\description{
Two types of permutation can be carried out: 1) 'noagg': each individual of
each species is reassigned a plot randomly which removes any patterns due to
within and between plot spatial aggregation, but maintains species group
abundance and therefore observed group N, and 2) 'swapN': the total number of
individuals in a plot is shuffled and then that many individuals are drawn
randomly from the group specific species-abundance distribution for each plot
which provides a means of removing group differenes in the total number of
individuals in a given sample. Note: The 'noagg' algorithim fixes the total number
of individuals for a given species within a group and the 'swapN' algorithim does
not.
