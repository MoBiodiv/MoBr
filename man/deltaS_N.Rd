\description{
Difference between the individual and sample-based rarefaction 
  curves for one group with the evaluation sample size (number of individuals)
  defined by ref_dens, evaluated at specified points (given by inds) Output:
  a two-column data frame, with sample size (effort) and deltaS (effect of N)
